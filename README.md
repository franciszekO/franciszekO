# Hi there, I'm Franciszek!

### Passionate Junior Software Developer & Creative Coder

I'm a developer who loves building backend logic and interactive systems. While my journey started in Game Development (experimenting with roguelikes and procedural generation), I'm currently focused on building robust software solutions and unique web experiences.
